This is my submission for the TOP "Rock, Paper, Scissors!" challenge. 

I'm certain there are better ways of coding this, but it's functional and more than anything I want to get to my path courses lol. 

Maybe I'll revisit the code in the future and look back on it with a mix of fondness for my cute "beginner" coding self and cringe at how poorly it was written. I guess the only
way to find out is to keep going. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
